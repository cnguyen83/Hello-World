# hello-world

A sandbox for practicing basic coding in various languages.

## Languages
The different languages in this practice repository are:
* C++
* Elm
* Rust
* Scala

### C++
This language sandbox only has a "Hello, World!" program.

### Elm
This language has no "Hello, World!" program, but is composed of a ```hello-elm``` folder (yes, poor naming choice).

The ```hello-elm``` folder contains multiple ```.elm``` files. They are small example exercises from the official Elm language guide. More information about the Elm guide can be found at [An Introduction to Elm on GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/evancz/an-introduction-to-elm/details) or at [An Introduction to Elm on elm-lang.org](https://guide.elm-lang.org/).

The exercises in ```hello-elm``` follow the guide and were recreated by me, but pre-made ```.elm``` files for the exercises can be found at [evancz's GitHub](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial).

### Rust
This language sandbox has both a "Hello, World!" program, as well as a ```rust_cargo``` folder.

The ```rust_cargo``` folder contains multiple Rust cargos. The entire folder is used for example exercises throughout the The Rust Book, a tutorial guide for Rust. More information about The Rust Book can be found at [rust-lang/book GitHub repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/book)

### Scala
This language sandbox only has a "Hello, World!" program.
